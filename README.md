# Adventurous Syntax black theme

A black Atom theme using common colours often seen in the cult series **Adventure Time**.

This theme is a black version of my favorite theme of all time.

Based on the Base16 Tomorrow Dark syntax theme by the Atom team.

**Why?** Because Adventure Time's colours are crisp and awesome!
